Title: Explaining Python Code used for Data Visualization for task_1:
Python Libraries Used:
Explain the two libraries imported:

- Pandas: Overview of its purpose in data handling and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Introduction to its role in data visualization.

Reading the CSV File:

** Reading the CSV File:
- Code: data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
- Explanation:Clarification on loading data into a Pandas DataFrame.

** Data Inspection:
- Code: print(data.head())
- Explanation: Interpretation of head() method and its display of the DataFrame's structure.

** Data Extraction:
- Code: DistributioOf60th = data['1960']
- Explanation: Clarification on extracting specific columns from the DataFrame.

** Plotting the Histogram:
- Code:

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

plt.hist(DistributioOf60th, bins=30, color='purple', edgecolor='black')

plt.xlabel('World Development Indicators for 1960')

plt.ylabel('Frequency/Count')

plt.title('Distribution of 1960')

plt.grid(axis='y')

plt.tight_layout()

plt.show()


- Explanation:

-- 'plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))': This line creates a new Matplotlib figure with a size of 8x6 inches for the upcoming plot.

-- 'plt.hist(DistributioOf60th, bins=30, color='purple', edgecolor='black')': This line creates a histogram using Matplotlib's hist() function. It visualizes the distribution of the DistributioOf60th variable with 30 bins, using a purple color for bars and a black edge color.

--'plt.xlabel('World Development Indicators for 1960') and plt.ylabel('Frequency/Count')': These lines set the labels for the x-axis and y-axis of the plot, respectively.

-- 'plt.title('Distribution of Ages')': This line sets the title of the plot to 'Distribution of Ages'.

-- 'plt.grid(axis='y')': This line adds gridlines along the y-axis to the plot for better readability.

-- 'plt.tight_layout()': This line adjusts the layout of the plot to prevent overlapping elements.

-- 'plt.show()': This line displays the plot.


- Conclusion:
 
- In this document, we explored a Python script designed for data visualization and analysis using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The script follows a systematic approach to load data from a CSV file, inspect its structure, extract specific columns, and visualize the distribution of a continuous variable ('DistributioOf60th') through a histogram.

The process begins by leveraging Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation, to read the contents of a CSV file into a DataFrame. This initial step ensures easy handling and analysis of structured data.

After loading the data, the code inspects the DataFrame by displaying the first few rows using the 'head()' method, offering a quick overview of the dataset's structure and contents.

Subsequently, the code extracts the '1960' column from the DataFrame, facilitating the isolation of a specific variable of interest for analysis.

The core of the code lies in the creation of a histogram using Matplotlib. This visualization technique effectively portrays the distribution of DistributioOf60th in the dataset, providing insights into the frequency or count of different DistributioOf60th groups. The histogram's axes, labels, title, and gridlines contribute to a clear representation of the data distribution.

Overall, this Python script showcases the seamless integration of Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization, demonstrating an essential workflow for loading, exploring, and visually analyzing datasets. Through this code, users can gain valuable insights into the distribution of continuous variables, aiding in exploratory data analysis and decision-making processes in various fields, such as statistics, research, and machine learning.

This documentation serves as a fundamental guide to understanding the code's functionality, facilitating learning and application in data-related tasks.
